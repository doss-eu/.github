# DOSS (Digital Operations Security System)

DOSS, or Digital Operations Security System, is an innovative project funded under the EU Horizon 2020 programme. It stands as a pivotal advancement in ensuring the security and resilience of complex IoT architectures. With a focus on supply chain monitoring, component testing, and architecture modeling, DOSS introduces a secure-by-design methodology complemented by cutting-edge technology.

## Objectives

- **Supply Trust Chain Integration**: DOSS integrates key stages of the IoT supply chain into a digital communication loop, facilitating the exchange of security-related information.
- **Security Verification**: All hardware and software components undergo rigorous security verification within the modeled architecture.
- **Device Security Passport**: A novel concept, the "Device Security Passport," will be defined for third-party hardware and its components, ensuring transparency and accountability.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Third-party software, open-source applications, and in-house developments will undergo thorough testing and assessment.
- **Digital Cybersecurity Twin**: A flexibly configurable model, leveraging AI to simulate diverse IoT architectures, predict attack scenarios, and recommend protective measures.
- **Architecture Security Validator**: A configurable, automated module designed to assess and pre-certify modeled IoT architectures against relevant security standards and KPIs.
- **End-to-End Protection**: Ensuring security coverage across the entire supply chain, from device onboarding to backend operations, with diverse monitoring technologies and a feedback loop for continuous improvement.

## Validation Domains

DOSS's robust procedures and technology will undergo validation across three IoT domains:

1. **Automotive**
2. **Energy**
3. **Smart Home**

## Impact and Future Outlook

DOSS represents a pioneering step towards implementing the principles outlined in the European Cyber Resilience Act. By providing an operational reference model and policy recommendations, DOSS aims to contribute significantly to standardization efforts in the field of IoT security.
